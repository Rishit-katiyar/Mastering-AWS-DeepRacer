In this level 4 reward function:

- It continues to reward the agent for staying within the track borders, penalizing excessive steering, and maintaining a desired speed, as in level 3.
- Additionally, it introduces rewards for reaching waypoints and penalties for collisions with obstacles.
- The agent is rewarded if it is heading towards the next waypoint within a certain angle threshold (Ï€/4 radians in this example).
- It penalizes the agent if it detects obstacles within a certain distance (MIN_OBJECTS_DISTANCE), discouraging collisions with obstacles.

This enhanced reward function adds more complexity by incorporating waypoint navigation and obstacle avoidance, encouraging the agent to follow the desired path and avoid obstacles while maintaining smooth and efficient driving behavior. Adjustments to the waypoint angle threshold and minimum objects distance can be made based on the specific characteristics of the track and obstacles.
