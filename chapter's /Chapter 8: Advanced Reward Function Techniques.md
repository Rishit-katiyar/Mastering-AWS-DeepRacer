## Chapter 8: Advanced Reward Function Techniques

### Composite Rewards:
Composite rewards represent a sophisticated approach to shaping agent behavior by combining multiple reward components into a unified reward signal. This enables agents to learn complex behaviors and achieve high performance across diverse environments. The composition of composite rewards involves intricate strategies for weighting individual components, applying nonlinear transformations, and dynamically adjusting reward contributions based on environmental context and agent behavior. By leveraging composite rewards, reinforcement learning agents can effectively navigate complex decision spaces, adapt to changing conditions, and optimize performance across multiple objectives.

```python
# Composite Rewards
def composite_reward(component1, component2, weights):
    weighted_component1 = weights[0] * component1
    weighted_component2 = weights[1] * component2
    composite_reward = weighted_component1 + weighted_component2
    return composite_reward
```

### Inverse Reinforcement Learning:
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a sophisticated framework for inferring reward functions from expert demonstrations or observed behaviors. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning paradigms, which require explicit reward specification, IRL algorithms learn reward structures implicitly from observed trajectories. This enables agents to mimic expert behavior, adapt to complex environments, and generalize effectively to new scenarios. Common approaches in IRL include maximum entropy IRL, Bayesian IRL, and adversarial IRL, each with distinct advantages and trade-offs in terms of computational complexity and sample efficiency.

```python
# Inverse Reinforcement Learning
def inverse_rl(expert_trajectories):
    inferred_reward_function = learn_reward_function(expert_trajectories)
    return inferred_reward_function
```

### Curriculum Learning:
Curriculum learning provides a principled approach to reward function design by scaffolding the learning process and gradually increasing task complexity. By exposing agents to a curriculum of tasks with varying difficulty levels, curriculum learning accelerates learning progress, enhances sample efficiency, and promotes robust skill acquisition. Reward functions designed using curriculum learning may incorporate task difficulty parameters to modulate reward signals and dynamically adjust task complexity based on agent proficiency and environmental conditions.

```python
# Curriculum Learning
def curriculum_reward(task_difficulty):
    base_reward = calculate_base_reward()
    curriculum_factor = calculate_curriculum_factor(task_difficulty)
    reward = base_reward + curriculum_factor
    return reward
```

### Multi-Objective Optimization:
Multi-objective optimization techniques address the challenge of optimizing reward functions with multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. In the context of autonomous racing, agents must balance trade-offs between speed, safety, and energy efficiency. Multi-objective optimization algorithms seek Pareto-optimal solutions that represent the best compromise between competing objectives, allowing decision-makers to explore the trade-offs inherent in complex decision-making problems. Common approaches include evolutionary algorithms, scalarization methods, and Pareto-based optimization techniques, each with distinct advantages and trade-offs in solution quality, computational complexity, and scalability.

```python
# Multi-Objective Optimization
def multi_objective_reward(objective_weights):
    objectives = calculate_objectives()
    reward = sum(objective_weights[i] * objectives[i] for i in range(num_objectives))
    return reward
```
