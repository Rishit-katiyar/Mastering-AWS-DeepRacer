## Chapter 3: Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning

### Introduction to Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning concerned with training agents to make sequential decisions in order to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, where training data is labeled, RL agents learn from interactions with an environment through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, allowing it to learn optimal strategies over time.

### Key Components of RL:
1. **Agents:** RL agents are entities that interact with an environment to achieve specific goals. They make decisions based on observations and feedback received from the environment.
2. **Environments:** Environments represent the context in which RL agents operate. They consist of states, actions, transition dynamics, and reward mechanisms.
3. **States:** States are representations of the environment's current configuration or condition. They encapsulate all relevant information needed for decision-making.
4. **Actions:** Actions are the decisions made by agents to transition between states. They influence the environment and determine the subsequent state and reward.
5. **Rewards:** Rewards are numerical values that indicate the desirability of a particular state-action pair. Agents seek to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
6. **Policies:** Policies define the mapping between states and actions, specifying the agent's behavior in different situations.

### Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):
MDPs are mathematical frameworks used to model sequential decision-making problems in RL. They consist of:
- **States (S):** A set of possible configurations or conditions of the environment.
- **Actions (A):** A set of possible decisions or choices available to the agent.
- **Transition Probabilities (P):** Functions that specify the probability of transitioning from one state to another given a particular action.
- **Rewards (R):** Numerical values associated with state-action pairs that indicate the immediate desirability of taking a specific action in a given state.

### Exploration vs. Exploitation:
In RL, agents face the dilemma of choosing between exploration and exploitation. Exploration involves trying out new actions to discover potentially better strategies, while exploitation entails selecting actions that are known to yield high rewards based on past experience. Finding the right balance between exploration and exploitation is crucial for effective learning and optimal decision-making in RL algorithms. Various strategies, such as epsilon-greedy policies and upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms, are employed to address this trade-off and ensure efficient learning over time.
