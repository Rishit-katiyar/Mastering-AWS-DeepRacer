## Chapter 7: Reward Function Components

### Distance-based Rewards:
Distance-based rewards utilize distance metrics to shape the behavior of reinforcement learning agents in autonomous racing scenarios. These rewards incentivize the agent to maintain proximity to key elements of the track environment, such as the centerline, waypoints, or obstacles. The following Python code snippet demonstrates a distance-based reward function:

```python
# Distance-based Rewards
def distance_reward(distance):
    if distance < DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_1:
        reward = REWARD_HIGH
    elif distance < DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_2:
        reward = REWARD_MEDIUM
    else:
        reward = REWARD_LOW
    return reward
```

### Progress-based Rewards:
Progress-based rewards motivate agents to make forward progress along the track and achieve key milestones during racing tasks. These rewards track the agent's progress in terms of lap completion, track coverage, and lap times. The following code snippet illustrates a progress-based reward function:

```python
# Progress-based Rewards
def progress_reward(progress):
    if progress > PROGRESS_THRESHOLD_1:
        reward = REWARD_HIGH
    elif progress > PROGRESS_THRESHOLD_2:
        reward = REWARD_MEDIUM
    else:
        reward = REWARD_LOW
    return reward
```

### Action-specific Rewards:
Action-specific rewards incentivize particular actions or behaviors that are desirable for autonomous racing agents. These rewards encourage behaviors such as maintaining a desired speed profile, following an optimal racing line, or avoiding collisions. The following code snippet demonstrates action-specific reward functions for speed and steering:

```python
# Action-specific Rewards
def speed_reward(speed):
    if speed > SPEED_THRESHOLD_1:
        reward = REWARD_HIGH
    elif speed > SPEED_THRESHOLD_2:
        reward = REWARD_MEDIUM
    else:
        reward = REWARD_LOW
    return reward

def steering_reward(steering):
    if abs(steering) < STEERING_THRESHOLD:
        reward = REWARD_HIGH
    else:
        reward = REWARD_LOW
    return reward
```

### Dynamic Rewards:
Dynamic rewards introduce variability and adaptability into the reward function, allowing it to respond dynamically to changes in the environment or the agent's behavior. These rewards may include penalties for off-track excursions, incentives for smooth driving, or adjustments based on environmental factors. Dynamic rewards enable agents to adapt their behavior to different racing scenarios and optimize their performance accordingly.
